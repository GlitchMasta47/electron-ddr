## Downloads
If you're looking for downloads, please know that this is unfinished software and is not ready for public use. If you would like to use this anyways, please contact me via Twitter or Discord.

## Running from the source code
Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed (they should be bundled together). If you don't, check their [website](https://www.nodejs.org/) for a download (LTS recommended). You can then [download a ZIP](https://github.com/GlitchMasta47/electron-ddr/archive/master.zip) of this repo or clone it via GitHub Desktop. (If you downloaded the ZIP file, make sure to extract the files to a safe location) In the folder that your copy of the source code is in, `npm i`nstall the dependencies. Once the dependencies have finished installing, you can then run `node index.js` to start the application.
